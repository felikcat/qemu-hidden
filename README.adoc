== About
This guide's goal is to be the easiest to follow, and to bypass some VM detections without slowing down performance. The guide built on CachyOS using systemd-boot and KDE Plasma desktop.

There will be no custom compiling QEMU in attempts to hide it. Later on, there may be an accompanying bootkit that I wrote to hide as many QEMU traces as I can muster. This'll take a long time, probably a year from now, so don't expect it any time soon or at all.

The host GPU is from AMD, while the guest (VM / Virtual Machine / VFIO) GPU is from NVIDIA.

NOTE: These instructions also work for GPUs from Intel or AMD, but there's no advice on resolving the reset bug or other problems they may have.

The operating system of choice is Windows 10 LTSC 2019, get it from the MyDigitalLife forums. Please don't use Windows 11, it https://borncity.com/win/2025/06/18/windows-11-server-2025-june-2025-updates-cause-bsod-in-proxmox-kvm-qemu/[will not work] without purposefully sacrificing your performance after the June 2025 updates.

== 1. GPU passthrough
Since the NVIDIA GPU won't be used on Linux, remove its drivers to prevent problems and lessen the system bloat. For me, OBS Studio kept trying to use NVIDIA drivers instead of the AMD drivers despite being installed: +
`sudo pacman -R nvidia-settings nvidia-utils lib32-nvidia-utils linux-cachyos-nvidia-open libxnvctrl libva-nvidia-driver`

NOTE: Ignore the errors for failing to find the NVIDIA GPU driver modules, as mkinitcpio will still work correctly.

Create the directory if it doesn't exist: +
`mkdir -p ~/.config/environment.d`

Edit `~/.config/environment.d/99-amdgpu.conf`
----
LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME=radeonsi
----

`sudo rm /etc/profile.d/nvidia-vaapi.sh`

This will fix the AMD GPU issue with OBS Studio after a reboot (don't reboot now).

Find the IDs to pass to vfio-pci for your guest GPU: +
`lspci -vnn`

For this example, you would passthrough the IDs `10de:2705` and `10de:22bb`:

Apply the bootloader kernel option changes: +
`sudo sdboot-manage gen`

Apply the new modprobe.d and mkinitcpio.conf changes: +
`sudo mkinitcpio -P`

Reboot your PC: +
`reboot`

== 2. Virtual machine requisites

Install the necessary packages: +
`sudo pacman -S qemu-desktop virt-manager iptables-nft dnsmasq virglrenderer hwloc dmidecode usbutils swtpm samba`

Assign your user to the correct groups to prevent issues in the future: +
`sudo usermod -a -G qemu,video,kvm,libvirt,libvirt-qemu "$USER"`

Sudo edit: `/etc/libvirt/network.conf`, and change `firewall_backend` to `iptables`. This is necessary since we're using iptables-nft and not nftables standalone.

Enable and start the required services to use Virtual Machine Manager: +
`sudo systemctl enable --now libvirtd.service`


== 3. Virtual machine setup

Enable XML editing in Virtual Machine Manager before doing anything else: Edit -> Preferences -> Check "Enable XML editing", then close.

Ensure the disk file location you'll use for the VM is mounted to `/mnt` instead of `/run/media`, or you could pass-through an entire NVMe disk. Up to you.

When creating a disk file, ensure its Format is 'raw' instead of 'qcow', and https://www.gbmb.org/tb-to-gib[use this calculator] to get exact disk size measurements. VirtualBox is the only good option for snapshots in my opinion, so if you do malware analysis, that's the way to go.

Add an additional SATA CDROM to the VM, so you can load the latest `virtio-win-*.iso` into it; get the ISO from https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/direct-downloads/archive-virtio/?C=M;O=D[here]. At first this is used so you have disk drivers, but later on you can install all of its drivers inside of the VM by running `virtio-win-guest-tools` (after Windows is installed).

Add the PCI Host Device for your NVIDIA GPU and its accompanying audio device.

Install Windows 10 LTSC 2019 as it is the best edition to use for performance and stability.

WARNING: Make sure the disk type is virtio before installing Windows 10, otherwise you have to follow these steps to correct this mistake later for higher performance: https://superuser.com/a/1253728


== 4. Looking Glass setup

`paru -S looking-glass looking-glass-module-dkms obs-plugin-looking-glass`

https://looking-glass.io/docs/B7/ivshmem_kvmfr/[Follow through the official documentation] but skip past the "Installing" step as you've already done that the Arch way.

NOTE: Run `sudo chmod 0660 /dev/kvmfr0` if you're getting permission errors for `/dev/kvmfr0` from QEMU.

Install the Looking Glass Host to the Windows VM, and run it.

Be sure to plug in a display port into the passed through GPU, otherwise Looking Glass will not work. It could be a real HDMI or DisplayPort plug (recommended), or a dummy plug.

To stop the annoyance of getting asked to allow the microphone and hide the microphone icon, edit: `~/.config/looking-glass/client.ini`:
----
[audio]
micDefault=allow
micShowIndicator=no
----

Ensure the display scaling in KDE Plasma is set to intervals of 25%, otherwise Looking Glass will look blurry (such as on 115% scaling instead of 125% scaling).

== 5. Optimizing VM performance and hiding the VM from some software

Looking Glass has https://looking-glass.io/docs/B7/install_libvirt/#keyboard-mouse-display-audio[its own recommendations], follow those in addition to what my guide recommends below.

For the XML changes below, here is the topology of the 9800X3D CPU used (relevant for the CPU pinning): +
image:lstopo.png[]

Show the hardware topology to understand what your CPU's pinning would look like, but make sure to press kbd:[f] if there appears to be missing CPU cores: +
`lstopo`

Set or change the following in your VM XML:

Create the automatic hooks directory: +
`sudo mkdir -p /etc/libvirt/hooks`

Sudo edit: `/etc/libvirt/hooks/qemu`; change the vm_running and vm_not_running core numbers to what's applicable to your CPU.
----
#!/bin/sh

command=$2
# It's based on Logical (L#) cores, not Physical (P#) cores.
vm_running="14-15"
vm_not_running="0-15"

if [ "$command" = "started" ]; then
    systemctl set-property --runtime -- system.slice AllowedCPUs=${vm_running}
    systemctl set-property --runtime -- user.slice AllowedCPUs=${vm_running}
    systemctl set-property --runtime -- init.scope AllowedCPUs=${vm_running}
elif [ "$command" = "release" ]; then
    systemctl set-property --runtime -- system.slice AllowedCPUs=${vm_not_running}
    systemctl set-property --runtime -- user.slice AllowedCPUs=${vm_not_running}
    systemctl set-property --runtime -- init.scope AllowedCPUs=${vm_not_running}
fi
----

.Go into the Windows VM and do the following:
- Run "Edit group policy". Go to Computer Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> System -> Device Guard -> Turn On Virtualization Based Security, and set it to "Enabled". Ensure "Select Platform Security Level" is set to "Secure Boot", and the rest of the options are left as "Not Configured".
- Run "Turn Windows features on or off". Ensure that "Guarded Host", "Hyper-V", "Virtual Machine Platform", "Windows Hypervisor Platform", "Windows Sandbox", and "Windows Subsystem for Linux" is left unchecked as these features will destroy performance.

== 6. Sharing files to the Windows VM without enabling shared memory (for better performance)

Edit: `/etc/samba/smb.conf`
----
[global]
# Security
client min protocol = SMB3
## SMB3_11 is also faster than previous versions.
server min protocol = SMB3
## Allow local IPs.
hosts allow = 192.168.0.0/16
## Deny all other IPs.
hosts deny = 0.0.0.0/0
restrict anonymous = 2
disable netbios = Yes
dns proxy = No
# Performance
use sendfile = Yes
## Don't use outside local IPs! 
smb encrypt = No
# Other
server role = standalone server
# Disable printer support
disable spoolss = Yes
load printers = No
printcap name = /dev/null
show add printer wizard = No
printing = bsd

# 'share1' is what Windows 10 will see in its file manager.
[share1]
path = /directory/to/folder
read only = No
## If the user is not 'admin', rename the group and user.
force group = admin
force user = admin
----

Validate the SMB server config, it should return no errors: +
`testparm`

Add an SMB login for your username. It's recommended to use a different password than your real Linux password: +
`sudo smbpasswd -a $USER`

Allow the SMB ports through the firewall: +
`sudo ufw allow 445; sudo ufw allow 139`

Enable and start the SaMBa service: +
`sudo systemctl enable --now smb.service`

Find the correct local IP address to connect to inside the Windows VM for the file sharing; for me the interface was "enp14s0": +
`ip a`

Open the 'Run' program in the Windows VM, and run: `\\192.168.50.179` (replace with your local IP that was shown earlier).
